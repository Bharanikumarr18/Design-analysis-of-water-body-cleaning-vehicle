## 📄 Project Overview

This project aims to design an efficient and low-cost vehicle capable of removing floating waste materials from lakes, ponds, and other stagnant water bodies. The design was created in Fusion 360 with careful attention to real-world feasibility, mobility in water, and ease of fabrication.

## ✅ The Vehicle Has:
- A floating body that stays stable on water  
- A front belt system that picks up floating waste  
- Simple motors or paddles to help it move forward  
- A design that is easy to build and repair
